        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>As a qualified Computer Science teacher, I have taught across London in both all-boys and all-girls schools (pupils aged 11 - 18) whilst spending some time in mixed secondary and primary schools. This has allowed me to teach and relate to a wide range of students, some of whom made independent requests to the headmaster that I stay on!  Currently, I have just taken a post in the TES school of the year, with the intention of helping students develop academically and personally as they move into adulthood.</p>

        <p>Given my background in Computing, Web Development and Programming, alongside 8 years working within the Systems Support industry,  I have developed the knowledge and resources to cover teaching at all ages: from Primary School to A-Level, and beyond.</p>

        <p>Everyone learns in a slightly different way and at different speeds so my lessons are diverse, structured around and tailored to students' needs. Some lessons are highly structured, where a new concept is taught or practice is required; others are less structured to enable development of independent skills, such as problem-solving, resilience to adversity or searching for the correct code modules to incorporate into a program.  All of these are crucial components in enabling students to become good programmers and problem solvers.</p>
